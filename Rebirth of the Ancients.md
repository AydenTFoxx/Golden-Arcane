# Golden Arcane - Rebirth

To the uninitiated, *Golden Arcane* has had many versions over its significantly large lifespan. From a Bedrock add-on, to Java datapack (1st version, made for Minecraft 1.20.1), to a new datapack (2nd version, made for MC 1.21.4; [released on Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/datapack/goldark/version/0.1.0-legacy)), and finally, a third, remastered version -- that is the one you see right now.

From its earliest days to modern times, many things have changed; Minecraft and datapacks have deeply changed in what features are available to be worked with; Knowledge from past "Golden Arcane" iterations allowed me to do previously unthinkable feats; Even I, in more ways than one, also changed over time.

Thus, tides of changes have brought forth a new, overhauled version of **Golden Arcane**, one that I'm far happier with, and have no plans to rush or sloppily code in the foreseeable future; A work worth of the amount of attention this simple project has received over the years.

## In terms of features...

The "legacy" *Golden Arcane* had several features which either didn't quite make it to the new version (yet, or at all), while others have been repurposed into something else.

If a feature is not listed here, it is likely similar enough to the original to be intuitive to a previous user.

### Unimplemented features

The following features have NOT been added to the new *Golden Arcane* version, yet:

> [!NOTE]  
> These features are likely to show up again in a future update, but most likely with substantial changes to its implementation.

- Vempyre Path
- Extended/Strong variants for Potion items
- Holy Sickness
- Holy Numbness
- Iron Aspect
- Vial of Blood/Bloodlust
- Transmutation Recipes
- Soul Shard
- Magic Cauldron (and Essences mechanic)
- Arcane Path evolutions

### Removed features

The following features have NOT been added to the new *Golden Arcane*, and will NOT be added in future updates:

> [!WARNING]
> These features are not planned to be added again whatsoever, unless stated otherwise. In the foreseeable future though, there is no plan of re-adding these.

- Bloodlust
- Thunder/Thunderous Egg
- Judgement spell
- Potion of Lesser Healing
- Potion of Lesser Harming
- Pig
  - Pig (Tactical)
    - Pig (Nuke)

### Overhauled features

The following features have been added to the new *Golden Arcane*, but in a different manner:

> [!NOTE]
> These features had a different name or implementation in the legacy version, and have been added in a different manner since.

- Potion of Purification: Now [Amulet of Purity](github.com/AydenTFoxx/Golden-Arcane/blob/main/assets/Miscellaneous.md#amulet-of-purity).
- Vempyre Path's blood abilities: Reworked and added to [Werewoof](github.com/AydenTFoxx/Golden-Arcane/blob/main/assets/Paths.md#werewoof) as "kill streak/combo abilities".
- Vempyrism (Enchantment): Overhauled into **Demanding** enchantment; See [Blood Wielder](https://github.com/AydenTFoxx/Golden-Arcane/blob/main/assets/Spell%20Recipes.md#conjure-blood-weapon).
- Scarecrow: Reworked into [Ward](https://github.com/AydenTFoxx/Golden-Arcane/blob/main/assets/Spell%20Recipes.md#ward) spell.
- Scarebow: Reworked into [Deflect](https://github.com/AydenTFoxx/Golden-Arcane/blob/main/assets/Spell%20Recipes.md#deflect) spell.

## On Licensing

*Golden Arcane*'s initial versions (including the one released on Modrinth) were licensed under the [MIT License](https://mit-license.org). This has not changed, and these versions will keep their former licensing.

However, new versions (i.e. all code from this repository) are licensed under the [Apache 2.0 License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0); Most users are not impacted by this change, but it is something to be aware of.

## Ending notes

This is not by any way an exaustive list of changes from the previous version, but should give you a general idea that *both versions of "Golden Arcane" are entirely different iterations of the same project*. This means that while sharing the "Gold is magic" motif and some inherited features, both are fundamentally different experiences, and should be treated as such.
